# Crypto-Currency-for-the-Local-Market
This is the evolution of my first crypto currency. It has expiration date and it rewards with a 5% of the total purchase for encouraging the local trade. 
COLOCOIN is a cryptocurrency designed to support local commerce within a community or region. Its main goal is to encourage spending at local stores during a limited time period, such as the holiday season, through a rewards system and token expiration.

Key Features
Standard ERC20 token named Coloca Coin with symbol COLOCOIN.

5% Reward: Each time a user buys at an authorized store, they receive an additional 5% tokens as an incentive.

Authorized Store Management: The contract owner can add or remove stores where COLOCOIN can be used.

Expiration Date: Tokens have an expiration date to promote quick spending during specific campaigns (e.g., Christmas).

Transfer Lock After Expiration: After the expiration date, normal token transfers are blocked.

Burn Expired Tokens: The owner can burn tokens that have expired to clean up the supply.


The project aims to boost the local economy by encouraging residents to spend at nearby businesses using a community currency. The expiration feature adds urgency to use tokens during specific campaigns, preventing hoarding or speculation.

# Benefits of Using Local Cryptocurrency vs. Traditional Money

1. Transparency and Traceability
Blockchain transactions are public and verifiable, which can help ensure that rewards and token movements are used as intended, preventing fraud or misuse.

This builds trust between merchants and consumers.

2. Programmable Incentives
You can program automatic rules (smart contracts) to grant instant rewards, set expirations, or set specific conditions without intermediaries.

Example: the 5% reward automatically granted when purchasing from authorized stores, or automatic expiration.

3. Local Control and Autonomy
The community can create its own currency without relying on banks, governments, or intermediaries.

It allows for the design of a closed circular economy that directly drives local commerce.
